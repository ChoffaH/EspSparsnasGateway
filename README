This is a Mqtt Gateway for Ikeas energy monitor Sparsnas. The monitor 
sends encoded data by radio to a control panel. This device collects the data 
and sends it to Mqtt-enabled receivers in Json-format. Thus you need a Mqtt broker 
in your network and adjust the settings  in the ino-file:

// Settings for the Mqtt broker:
#define MQTT_USERNAME "<username>"    // If used by the broker     
#define MQTT_PASSWORD "<password>"     //    -   *   -
const char* mqtt_server = "192.168.1.79";  // Mqtt brokers IP

The data is also printed to the seriaÄº port. If the reception is bad, the received data can be bad. 
This gives a CRC-error, the data is in this case not sent via Mqtt but printed via the serial port. 

The data sent via Mqtt is in Json format and looks like this:

{"seq":13688,"effect":2024,"total":1821.344,"battery":100}
